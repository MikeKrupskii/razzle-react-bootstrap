## react-razzle-bootstrap
This is a React boilerplate that was created with [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle).

It has Redux with Redux-Form and Redux-Thunk for state management and form validation. React-Router-Dom for routing and Reactstrap for Bootstrap styling. On the back-end, Node handles the server-side rendering (thanks to Razzle setup) and an API for Mongo DB queries. It uses Passport for authentication.

The main idea of this repo is to start a server-side rendered React project with some essential features like Bootstrap, form-validation, user authentication, API setup and database handling.
