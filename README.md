## react-razzle-bootstrap
This is a React boilerplate that was created with [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle).

It has [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) with [Redux-Form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form) and [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) for state management and form validation. [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for routing and [Reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap) for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) styling. On the back-end, Node handles the server-side rendering (thanks to Razzle setup) and an API for Mongo DB queries with [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose). It uses [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) for authentication.

The main idea of this repo is to start a server-side rendered React project with some essential features like Bootstrap, form-validation, user authentication, API setup and database handling.
